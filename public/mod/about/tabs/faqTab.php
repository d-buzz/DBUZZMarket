        <p class="lead">What is Hive?</p>
        <p>Hive is a delegated-proof-of-stake social media blockchain. Users have a wallet that holds Hive crypto, and by staking some of their crypto in a process called powering up they get vote power. There is built-in inflation that funds a reward pool, which is paid out to content creators that earn it via upvotes from users with Hive Power.</p>

        <p>Decentralized Applications are pieces of software that can run outside of centralized servers and app stores. They are resiliant in their ability to be distributed peer-to-peer, and their minimization on external dependencies.</p>
        <p class="lead">What is a DEX?</p>
